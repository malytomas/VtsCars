# Building

Either download and install the VTS plugin from Asset Store:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/vts-landscape-streaming-plugin-125885

Or clone and build the VTS plugin from sources:
https://github.com/melowntech/vts-browser-unity-plugin

Please note, this example game is developed together with the plugin and therefore it may depend on some features of the VTS plugin that are not yet published to the store, or vice-versa.
